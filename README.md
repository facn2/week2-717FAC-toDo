## Create a To-Do App  

### Our site can be seen here: https://facn2.github.io/week2-717FAC-toDo/

### User stories:

As a disorganised person I want to:

+ enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
+ mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
+ the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

### TDD
We intend to write the three main functions using TDD method.

### Naming-Convention
+ Using camelCase for ID's, classes, and Variables

### How are we going to achieve the User Stories?
+ We will create a function for adding To-Do's
+  We will create a function for marking To-Do's
+ We will create a function for deleting To-Do's
